- reorganize `message` file
- cloning the message's image is expensive, I can use Arc<> to not clone the value, making it cheaper
- currently, handshakes handles both adding and deleting users
    - this means that if a user tries to use a name that is already in use, it will remove that user from the user list
    - make functions that explicitly add and remove users
    - this will allow the program to notify the client that the username is taken and will not remove the username that is already in use
- every frame, the UI is reloading images
    - use textured images or a cache
- improve error handling
- Add to server a room list
    - let the client choose which room to go into
